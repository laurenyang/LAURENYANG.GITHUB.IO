						<p> <em>Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie</em> reads like a fizzy soda on a hot summer day - it‚Äôs light, bubbly, refreshing, and dare I say‚Ä¶ lacking in nutrition. Smil gives a mile-high topography of a few different verticals: human population, countries, notable inventions, energy, transportation, food, and the environment. Don‚Äôt read it if you are looking for a deep dive into anything, as it‚Äôs written in a snappy, just-what-you-need-to-know style. I‚Äôm surprised Smil adopted this writing approach as he‚Äôs known for dense and detailed dissections. Personally, I didn‚Äôt enjoy this type of writing as it felt like it was designed to appeal to the 30-second attention span goldfish brain. I also wonder what nuances Smil had to abstract away in order to summarize such broad subjects into 1.5 page chapters. Because of this, it‚Äôs three stars for me. Read this book if you are looking for a smattering hodgepodge of loosely related facts.</p>
                        <p> Despite the lukewarm review, I still want to read Smil‚Äôs other books, most notably <em>Energy and Civilization: A History</em>.</p>

                                <li>Smil is funny - he points out in a world of food abundance, we are ironically pumping out fake meat. What if we focused on reducing food waste instead?</li>

                                    <li>French wine drinking has decreased from 40% to 16% (share of population who drink daily)</li>
                                    <li>When people say raising cattle requires a large amount of feed and water, they are referring to the resources spent growing feed <b>for the cattle</b>: ‚Äúabout 60 percent of the total crop harvest is now destined for feeding.‚Äù</li>
                                    <li>We don‚Äôt need to eradicate meat entirely. Shifting the distribution of meat from 40/37/23% to 40/50/10% pork/chicken/beef respectively would cut beef‚Äôs burden in half, while increasing meat supply by 10%.
