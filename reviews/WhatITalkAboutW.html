                        <p> Haruki is an avid runner, averaging 1 marathon a year and 6 miles per day. This book shares the lessons he’s learned from this sport, ranging across attitudes toward writing to life in general. It’s a light, fun, and entertaining read, and turned Murakami from a 2D novelist to a 3D human for me. Would recommend for those looking for a gentle walk through Haruki Murakami’s mind, but not for those seeking any groundbreaking epiphanies.   </p>

                            <legend> <b>Running is Mental </b></legend>
                            <ul>
                                <p class="aside">Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.</p>
                                <br>
                                <li>I resonate with his point that running is a mental exercise. If you put aside the physical mechanics of running, what remains is a simply you and your willpower. How hard you choose to push yourself, the cadence, the speed, all begins with your mind. </li>
                                <p class="aside">I am running to acquire a void.</p>
                                <br>
                                <li>Haruki uses running to “acquire a void.” I agree. When I run, I use the time to reflect on my past week, set goals for the day, and be in my thoughts. Concretely, running has help Haruki overcome smoking (he used to smoke up to 70 cigs a day), specifically the withdrawal symptoms. </li> 
                                <li><b>More Quotes</b></li><ul>
                                    <li>It doesn’t matter what field you’re talking about - beating somebody else just doesn’t do it for me. I’m much more interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself, so in this sense long-distance running is the perfect fit for a mindset like mine.</li>
                                    <li>Which is why the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being. When I’m running I don’t have to talk to anybody and don’t have to listen to anybody.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <p class="aside">Life is basically unfair. But even in a situation that’s unfair, I think it’s possible to seek out a kind of fairness. </p>
                                <br>
                                <li>I’m inspired by Haruki’s positivity. He notes that “having the kind of body that easily puts on weight [is] perhaps a blessing in disguise,” since you are forced to put in work to make yourself healthier and stronger. His message, which is nothing new, is mind over matter. </li>
                                <p class="aside">One of the privileges given to those who’ve avoided dying young is the blessed right to grow old. The honor of physical decline is waiting, and you have to get used to that reality. </p>
                                <br>
                                <li>He reinforces this principle when concluding that growing old is a blessing and a privilege - a refreshing take in a world increasingly obsessed with youth. As he grows older, Haruki is not sad that his body cannot physically keep the pace of his younger self; instead, he benchmarks on effort, and celebrates whenever he needs to try <b>harder</b> to achieve what once came more easily. </li>
                                <li><b>More Quotes</b></li><ul>
                                    <li>Whenever I was able to do something I liked to do, though, when I wanted to do it, and the way I wanted to do it, I’d give it everything I had.</li>
                                    <li>It’s pretty thin, the wall separating healthy confidence and unhealthy pride.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <p class="aside"> Writing novels and running full marathons are very much alike. Basically a writer has a quiet, inner motivation, and doesn’t seek validation in the outwardly visible.</p>
                                <li>Haruki believes running and writing require the same core two values:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Focus</li>
                                    <li>Endurance</li>
                                </ol>
                                <li>I’m not a writer, but I am a runner. Hearing it described this way helped me better understand what it takes to write fiction.</li>
                                <p class="aside">What’s needed for a writer of fiction ... is the energy to focus every day for half a year, or a year, two years.</p>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>In Japan, writing fiction is viewed as an unhealthy activity - “novelists are somewhat degenerate and have to live hazardous lives in order to write.”</li>
