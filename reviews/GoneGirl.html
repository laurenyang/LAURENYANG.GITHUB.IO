						<p>I devoured this book. <em>Gone Girl</em> is a bit trashy, a bit funny, a bit unbelievable, and a lot binge-able. It’s the type of book you read with a glass of wine with a bunch of girlfriends. <em>Gone Girl</em> is a thriller that follows husband-wife duo Nick and Amy amid Amy’s sudden disappearance on the eve of their 5th wedding anniversary. If you’re looking for a lil entertaining murder mystery, I recommend this. </p>
                        <p>Besides entertaining me, Gone Girl explored 3 interesting topics: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> <b>Beauty and age:</b> Amy seems to believe her value has decreased over time, or at least Nick has placed less value on her physical appearance as she grows older. This is a recurring theme throughout the book — she’s acutely aware of aging, of Nick (spoiler alert) cheating on her with a (big surprise) 23 year old, of her prettier, younger, past self. I was a bit surprised her self-value was placed so heavily on something known to fade quickly, and it made me wonder how I will value myself +5 or +10 years from now. I know this book is #notthatdeep, but this theme stood out salinity to me.</li>
                            <li> <b>Relationships:</b> I hope I never feel the spite Amy and Nick have towards each other. I didn’t know it was possible to be so kniving, calculated, and manipulative to an S.O. Or that you could keep <b>so many</b> secrets from each other. Those two have a twisted relationship. Amy also has a spiteful relationship with her parents. She’s lodged an unforgivable wedge between her and her parents, all stemming from a decision her parents made on behalf of her while growing up. Yet despite a privileged upbringing, a stable family, two parents who love her, and other hallmarks of a golden childhood, Amy feels vengeful. Again, I know it’s #notthatdeep, but anger and spite can drive people to do some crazy things.</li>
                            <li> <b>Manipulation:</b> I was struck by how Amy was time after time able to trick so many men. Either Amy is a master manipulator, or these boys were really dumb. Maybe both. Gillian Flynn, the author, most certainly crafted caricatures here, but one thing’s for certain: those who manipulate will get what they want. I’ve certainly seen my fair share of that in the real world too…</li>
                        </ol>

					<div class = "subsection-content"> 
                        <p> Prose was not the star of the show; nevertheless there were still some notable quotes:</p>
                        <fieldset>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They have no harsh edges with each other, no spiny conflicts, they ride through life like conjoined jellyfish—expanding and contracting instinctively, filling each other’s spaces liquidly. Making it look easy, the soul-mate thing. <mark class="highlight">&gt; Cheesy as it is, this is kind of cute. Used to describe Amy’s parents’ marriage.</mark> </li>
                                <li>So you suffer through the night with the perfect-on-paper man—the stutter of jokes misunderstood, the witty remarks lobbed and missed. Or maybe he understands that you’ve made a witty remark but, unsure of what to do with it, he holds it in his hand like some bit of conversational phlegm he will wipe away later. <mark class="highlight">&gt; “Conversational phlegm”. Will add this to my rolodex of weird but cool terms to use. </mark></li>
                                <li>This morning he was stroking my hair and asking what else he could do for me, and I said: “My gosh, Nick, why are you so wonderful to me?” He was supposed to say: You deserve it. I love you. But he said, “Because I feel sorry for you.” “Why?” “Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.”<mark class="highlight">&gt; See? Their relationship is so twisted but <b>so entertaining.</b> </mark></li>
                            </ul>
                        </fieldset>
