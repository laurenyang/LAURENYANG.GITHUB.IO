						<p >Here’s a hot take: reading &gt; TV. <em>Upgrade</em> reminded me how addicting good sci-fi could be. It’s been a while since I’ve read a “could not put down” thriller, and thankfully, this broke that streak. </p>
						<strong style="color: red">  ⛔  Spoiler alert!  ⛔ </strong> 
						<p>Upgrade is a sci-fi thriller which takes place when advanced gene-editing is possible (think CRISPR on steroids). People can modify their intelligence, reflexes, muscle mass, you name it — except it’s been illegal to do so ever since a genetic experiment went wrong and caused a worldwide famine. The main character, Logan, receives a genetic “upgrade” that enhances just about every human function. His hero’s journey is saving humanity by stopping his sister from giving this “upgrade” to everyone since the modifications have a decent mortality risk. </p>
						<p>Plot wise, it was okay. This is four stars because the story is fairly predictable. I could tell Crouch wrote this during lockdown since a the key events mirrored our COVID reality almost perfectly. I also thought the book could have had more psychological depth. Logan kills his sister as if it were a simple black and white decision; Crouch missed an opportunity to dig into a this decision here, but hey - guess this is an action book for a reason. </p>
						<p><em>Upgrade</em>’s action scenes enraptured me. The author, Blake Crouch, gives enough detail to make you feel like you were there at the scene, but not too much as to bog down the reading speed. Some scenes were so absurdly gruesome I couldn’t help but whisper <em>What the fuck</em> under my breath: when Logan and his sister found their dead mom rotting in a bus, when Logan and his sister fought in the forest, when Logan and his sister fought in her hideaway Colorado home, when Logan and his sister fought on the 40th floor at the abandoned skyscraper in underwater Manhattan … (I hope you’re picking up on a theme here. Logan and his sister fight a LOT). And my favorite scene: when Logan used a Bic pen to allow an enemy to breath again after breaking said enemy’s trachea. Morbid, right?</p>
						<p >Overall, <em>Upgrade</em> is great entertainment value. I’ve previously read Crouch’s <em>Dark Matter</em> and hope to read <em>Recursion</em> next. Pick up this book if you want to lose track of time, but don’t expect any deep philosophical epiphanies. </p>

							<li>And if our species has a problem with apathy, and feeling compassion for the pain of others in real time, how can we expect ourselves to conjure compassion for a tragedy that hasn’t even happened yet? The victims of Homo sapiens’ demise haven’t even been born. What emotional incentive do we have to make the sacrifices that will save future generations, if our brains aren’t capable of caring about them sufficiently?</li>
							<li>Tell me the advantage of feeling things deeply,” she said. “Doesn’tfeeling cloud logic and reason?” “To a point. Feelings are also the core of compassion and empathy.We’re becoming capable of rationalizing anything. Maybe sentiment helps with the checks andbalances.” “True. Or maybe you’re just afraid of growing beyond the people you love.”</li>
							<li>Denial. Selfishness. Magical thinking. We are not rational beings. Weseek comfort rather than a clear-eyed stare into reality. We consume and preen and convinceourselves that if we keep our heads in the sand, the monsters will just go away. Simply put, werefuse to help ourselves as a species. We refuse to do what must be done. Every danger we face linksultimately back to this failing.” <mark class="highlight">&gt; wonder what recent social andpolitical unrest inspired this… </mark></li>
