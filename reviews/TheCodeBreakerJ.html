                    <div class="subsection-content">
                        <p>This book was perfect for someone like me, who has little prior biochemistry knowledge. Isaacson strung together a strong narrative while providing the necessary context to gain a baseline understanding of the science. It is an expansive yet accessible book, ranging from the discovery of DNA‚Äôs double stranded structure, to Jennifer Dounda‚Äôs upbringing, to the ethical questions tied to genetic editing. This is my first Isaacson book, and I want to read more by him. </p>
                        <p>Aside from the factual reporting, Isaacson flags key ethical questions. Most people would agree to use genetic engineering to alleviate disabilities, but how should we define <em>disability</em>? Where is the line drawn between a disability and a trait, and how does that line relate to how accepting society is of the particular disability? ie, if disability <em>x</em> is more accepted than disability <em>y,</em> is it more ‚Äúok‚Äù to edit for disability y? </p>
                        <p>Should any genetic edits be evaluated with consideration to value to society? He raises a few examples of notable artists, scientists, and writers who attribute success (ie the spark of creativity, ability to persevere through challenge, etc) to their disability, and begs us to ponder if these contributions to society would have occurred if we allowed people to edit out disabilities at face value. What if you edit a child to have superIQ, and later she brings breakthrough value to the world - is this allowed, since this was an absolute improvement, even though the child gained a relative edge? </p>
                        <p>Other issues raised include the risk of reducing diversity if parents are inclined to edit to what is conventionally ‚Äúdesirable,‚Äù and the obvious likelihood that genetic engineering is guarded by wealth and thus widens the inequity gap. I wish Isaacson shared more perspectives from key contributors on this topic, but the thought experiments definitely sparked discussion with my friends and I. </p>
                        <p>Having examined other innovators like Da Vinci, Jobs, and Einstein, Isaacson draws parallels from the CRISPR narrative to these other worlds. Although I value identifying themes across subjects, this came across as a bit forced and unnecessary. I also wonder how biased the book is, as the story reads with a slight tilt against Zhang and co (rightfully so perhaps, but worth calling out that a non-fiction can still very much be subjective). </p>
                        <p>Overall, I gained exactly what I was seeking when I picked this book up: a digest-able and comprehensive tour of CRISPR and its related technologies. I‚Äôd recommend for anyone else looking for the same.</p>

                        <b>Testing</b>
                        <p>Mammoth and Sherlock Biosciences were launched to harness Cas12a/13 to detect sequence, then chop up luminescent capsule as positive test indicator</p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Vaccine</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traditional vaccines stimulate the immune system by delivering substance similar to virus/pathogen to patient to make antibodies (either a weakened or killed virus)</li>
                            <li>Invented in 1790s by Edward Jenner (Englishman) who noticed milkmaids were immune to smallpox bc they were previously exposed to cowpox (which didn‚Äôt affect humans)</li>
                            <li>Genetic vaccines: deliver genetic coding directly to human cell so they can produce components of virus, as opposed to injecting virus to patient. Benefit is immune system responses are erratic, better to directly target virus. Methods:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>J&amp;J vaccine: engineer into a harmless virus the desired component</li>
                                <li>DNA vaccine: give cell DNA/RNA to manufacture vaccine itself. Challenge = DNA delivery as it is housed in nucleus</li>
                                <li>RNA vaccine: easier to deliver than DNA vaccines as RNA is in cytoplasm (this is Pfizer+Moderna vaccines)</li>
                                <li>Ultimate solution: use CRISPR to guide scissors to directly chop up virus (like bacteria does)</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Cameron Myhrvold created the CARVER system</li>
                                        <li>Stanley Qi created PAC-MAN system</li>

                        <p>What makes a great scientist? </p>
                        <p class="aside">[Having] wide-ranging interests and were able to make connections between different disciplines.</p>
                        <p>... according to Isaacson. This is the case with Darwin and Wallace (another scientist who theorized natural selection around the same time) </p>
                        <p class="aside">Competition drives discovery</p><br>
                        <p class="aside">‚ÄúIf it were not for competitive people like Jennifer, our world would not be as good, ‚Äù she says.‚Äú Because what drives people to do good things is recognition.‚Äù</p>
                        <p>...competition </p>
                        <p class="aside">Arrogance? Common theme with scientists? Or just plain cockiness </p>
                        <p>....#deepbelief</p>
                        <p class="aside">Science advances are propelled by publicity.</p>
                        <p>...and of course fame üì∏. Though these aspects may all be overshadowed by what Isaacson believes is the strongest indicator of a quality scientist: curiosity. </p>
                        <p class="aside">The solution was too beautiful not to be true - Isaacson</p>
                        <br> <p class="aside">Never do something that a thousand other people are doing. - Szostak</p>
                        <br> <p class="aside">The camaraderie in the lab was not an accident: in hiring, Doudna placed as much emphasis on making sure someone was a good fit as she did assessing their research accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>Teamwork makes the dream work. Not a new idea, but confirms the common saying. Surprisingly this is not taken seriously at work or elsewhere as I‚Äôve heard / experienced too many instances where one bad egg can ruin a team. Pick your people carefully, folks!</p>
