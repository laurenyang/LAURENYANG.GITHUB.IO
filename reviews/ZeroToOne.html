                        <p>Thiel shares his philosophy on starting new companies in Zero to One. The book is a playful
                            balance of frameworks, personal anecdotes, and real world examples. Reads easy, like a
                            conversation. </p>
                        <p>Would recommend for anyone looking for an “Intro to Entrepreneurship”, but did not find
                            anything extremely contrarian ironically enough. Perhaps Thiel’s ideas have become so
                            popularized since the book’s publishing that they now define the norm? In general I’m wary
                            of Malcolm Gladwell-y books which draw sweeping conclusions from 1-2 examples. This book
                            errs on that, but can see this being a useful reference as one starts his/her own thing.</p>

                                    Netscape IPO Aug ‘95 despite being unprofitable 2) East Asian financial crisis hit
                                    July ‘97 3) Ruble crisis in August ‘98 where Russia defaulted on debt 4) Euro
                                    launched January ‘99 </li>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Make incremental advances: grand visions inflated the bubble. You should make
                                        small, tangible steps forward </li>
                                    <li>Stay lean and flexible: all companies must stay lean/unplanned, allowing you to
                                        iterate </li>
                                    <li>Improve on the competition: The only way to know you are a real business is to
                                        start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by
                                        improving on recognizable products </li>
                                    <li>Focus on product, not sales: tech is primarily about product dev, not
                                        distribution</li>
                                </ol>
                                <li>Yet the opposite of these rules is probably also correct </li>

                                <li>Creating value is not enough, you need to capture some of the value you create</li>
                                <li>Perfect Competition: in the long run, no firm makes any economic profit. Every firm
                                    is undifferentiated, must sell at market price, if there is more money supply, new
                                    firms will enter the market and increase supply, drive prices down, therefore
                                    eliminating profits</li>
                                <li>Fatal temptation: describe your market as extremely narrow so you dominate by
                                    definition</li>
                                <li>Monopoly: a company that is so good at what it does, no other company can offer
                                    close substitute</li>
                                <li>Monopolists lie to protect themselves: ie Google claiming to be in many different
                                    markets to hide their monopoly in search</li>
                                <li>Creative monopolists give customers more choice by adding entirely new categories of
                                    abundance</li>

                                <li>Proprietary tech: must be x10 better than closest substitute. Easiest way to be x10
                                    better is to invent something new </li>
                                <li>Network effects: product is valuable to first few users even if network is small
                                </li>
                                <li>Economies of scale: gets stronger as it gets bigger - fixed cost of creating a
                                    product can be spread over greater quantities of scale </li>
                                <li>Branding: a company has a monopoly over it’s brand by definition, so creating a
                                    strong brand is powerful way to claim a monopoly</li>

                                <li>Start small and monopolize - err on the side of starting too small, since it’s
                                    easier to dominate a smaller market</li>
                                <li>Scale up - after you dominate a niche market. Sequencing markets is important</li>
                                <li>Don’t disrupt - if your company can be summed by opposition to already existing
                                    firms, it’s not completely new and likely not a monopoly. Avoid competition as much
                                    as possible</li>

                                <li>Clearest pattern Thiel’s noticed is a company does better the less it pays its CEO,
                                    since cash poor CEO is focused on increasing value of the company. Equity is best

                                <li>Recruiting: should never be outsourced. When pitching, you should highlight company

                            <p class="aside">💡 Superior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation. The converse is not true. No matter how strong your product...you must still support it with a strong distribution plan</p>

                                    <li>Customer Acquisition Cost: amount you spend on average to acquire new customer </li>

                                <li>Complex Sales: Average 1M+ deals which take multiple months of relationships to
                                    cultivate. works best when you don’t have a salesman - CEOs talking directly to
                                    other CEOs</li>
                                <ul><li>Example: SpaceX, Palentir</li></ul>
                                <li>Personal Sales: deal size of 10-100k. CEO doesn’t do the selling. Challenge here is
                                    setting a process up for sales team of modest size to succeed with a wide audience
                                </li>
                                <ul><li>Example: Box sold product to Stanford Sleep Clinic where researchers used it</li></ul>
                                <li>Dead zone between personal sales and traditional advertising - product price point
                                    of 1k, no good distribution channel to reach small businesses who are your customer
                                </li>
                                <li>Marketing and Advertising: works well for low priced products with mass appeal but
                                    no viral distribution method</li>
                                    <ul><li>Example: Proctor and Gamble products</li></ul>
                                <li>Viral Marketing: product is viral if it encourages users to invite friends to become
                                    users too. Cheap and fast</li>

                                <li>Distribution law of sales: nailing one distribution channel is great! If you try
                                    multiple channels and don’t land any, you’re done. </li>
