                        <p> <em>China in 10 Words</em> provides a genuine, personal, and unfiltered view into Yu Han’s
                            experience during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward. I picked up this book
                            because I sought a deeper understanding of my cultural heritage. I wanted to know the China
                            my grandparents and parents grew up in. What I got was a collection of stories that gave
                            depth and dimension to a timeline of events. With simple, direct prose, Yu’s recollections
                            invoked joy, laughter, fear, dismay, frustration, curiosity, and astonishment from me. His
                            stories read with a familiar voice, perhaps because I’ve heard permutations of the same
                            experiences from my own relatives. I recommend this for anyone who wants to understand
                            history as a lived experience.  </p>

                                    reading it before the return date, pulls an all nighter taking turns copying the

                                    age when there is an excess of them — in China today, more than two hundred thousand
                                    books are published each year. In the past there were no books to buy, whereas now

                                    precisely this: that one can read a book by a writer of a different time, a
                                    different country, a different race, a different language, and a different culture
                                    and there encounter a sensation that is one’s very own. </p>

                                <li>One of Yu’s earliest writing experiences was creating <a

                                        posters</a>. The brutality of his day to day - beheadings, beatings, and blood
                                    on the streets - influenced the violent nature of his early works. So casually does
                                    Yu recount his experience:</li>
                                <p class="aside">For me it was a regular occurrence to walk down a street lined with big
                                    - character posters and run into people with blood streaming down their faces. </p>
                                <br>
                                <li>Being a writer is hard. Yu’s description of writing parallels <a

                                    high focus and endurance.</li>
                                <p class="aside">It was no easy matter to persuade my bottom to maintain such constant
                                    intimacy with my chair. Outside, on weekends, the sunshine was so enticing, birds
                                    were flitting to and fro, girls were laughing so sweetly, friends my age were
                                    gadding about, but I sat stiffly at my desk, expending as much energy on getting
                                    words out on paper as a blacksmith does beating iron into shape on his anvil. </p>

                                    answer is always simply: “By writing.” Writing is like experience: if you don’t
                                    experience things, then you won’t understand life; and if you don’t write, then you
                                    won’t know what you’re capable of creating.</p>

                                <li>This reminds me of ultra marathoner Dean Karnazes’ tip for running: to get better at

                                    we can trace the zigzags of history and detect the imprints of our social upheavals.

                            <li>It’s the lack of political transparency that has facilitated China’s breakneck growth.</li>
                            <li>One point, however, is clear: when society undergoes a drastic shift, an extremely repressed era soon becomes a very lax one. It’s like being on a swing: the higher you soar on one side, the higher you rise on the other.</li>
                            <li>Just look at China today: the urban high-rises shooting up like forests under a gray and murky sky; the thick mesh of expressways, far outnumbering our rivers; the dazzling array of merchandise in shopping centers and supermarkets; the endless lines of traffic and pedestrians in the streets; the constant glitter of advertisements and neon signs; the nightclubs and massage parlors, beauty salons and foot-washing joints, lining every block ; not to mention the luxury restaurants three or four floors high, each floor the size of an auditorium, rimmed on all sides by sumptuous private rooms, two or three thousand people all wining and dining, shiny - faced with satisfaction.</li>

One of Mao Zedong’s remarks sums up a basic characteristic of the Cultural Revolution. “We should support whatever the enemy opposes,” he said, “and oppose whatever the enemy supports.” The Cultural Revolution was an era when everything was painted in black and white, when the enemy was always wrong and we were always right; nobody had the courage to suggest that the enemy might sometimes be right and we might sometimes be wrong</li>
