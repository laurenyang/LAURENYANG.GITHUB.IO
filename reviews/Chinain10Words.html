						<p> <em>China in 10 Words</em> provides a genuine, personal, and unfiltered view into Yu Han’s experience during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward. I picked up this book because I sought a deeper understanding of my cultural heritage. I wanted to know the China my grandparents and parents grew up in. What I got was a collection of stories that gave depth and dimension to a timeline of events. With simple, direct prose, Yu’s recollections invoked joy, laughter, fear, dismay, frustration, curiosity, and astonishment from me. His stories read with a familiar voice, perhaps because I’ve heard permutations of the same experiences from my own relatives. I recommend this for anyone who wants to understand history as a lived experience.

He recalls sharing a library book with a friend, but upon realizing they both wouldn’t finish reading it before the return date, pulls an all nighter taking turns copying the text over. Humorously, neither could read the other’s handwriting. Contrast that with…</li>
