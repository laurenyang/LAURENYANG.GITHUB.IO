						<p> <em>China in 10 Words</em> provides a genuine, personal, and unfiltered view into Yu Han’s experience during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward. I picked up this book because I sought a deeper understanding of my cultural heritage. I wanted to know the China my grandparents and parents grew up in. What I got was a collection of stories that gave depth and dimension to a timeline of events. With simple, direct prose, Yu’s recollections invoked joy, laughter, fear, dismay, frustration, curiosity, and astonishment from me. His stories read with a familiar voice, perhaps because I’ve heard permutations of the same experiences from my own relatives. I recommend this for anyone who wants to understand history as a lived experience.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Yu grew up in time where many books, aka  “poisonous weeds”, were banned. He recalls sharing a library book with a friend, but upon realizing they both wouldn’t finish reading it before the return date, pulls an all nighter taking turns copying the text over. Humorously, neither could read the other’s handwriting. Contrast that with…</li>
                                <p class="aside">Now, thirty years later, we have moved from an age without books to an age when there is an excess of them — in China today, more than two hundred thousand books are published each year. In the past there were no books to buy, whereas now there are so many that we don’t know which ones to buy.</p>
                                <br> <li>Yu on the value of books. Not a groundbreaking or controversial take, but nevertheless an important one.</li>
                                <p class="aside">If literature truly possesses a mysterious power, I think perhaps it is precisely this: that one can read a book by a writer of a different time, a different country, a different race, a different language, and a different culture and there encounter a sensation that is one’s very own. </p>
                            </ul>

                                <li>One of Yu’s earliest writing experiences was creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-character_poster">big character posters</a>. The brutality of his day to day - beheadings, beatings, and blood on the streets - influenced the violent nature of his early works. So casually does Yu recount his experience:</li>
                                <p class="aside">For me it was a regular occurrence to walk down a street lined with big -  character posters and run into people with blood streaming down their faces. </p>
                                <br> <li>Being a writer is hard. Yu’s description of writing parallels <a href="WhatITalkAboutW.html">Haruki Murakami’s</a>: it’s not easy and requires high focus and endurance.</li>
                                <p class="aside">It was no easy matter to persuade my bottom to maintain such constant intimacy with my chair. Outside, on weekends, the sunshine was so enticing, birds were flitting to and fro, girls were laughing so sweetly, friends my age were gadding about, but I sat stiffly at my desk, expending as much energy on getting words out on paper as a blacksmith does beating iron into shape on his anvil. </p>
                                <br> <p class="aside">Years later young people often ask, “How does one become a writer?” My answer is always simply: “By writing.” Writing is like experience: if you don’t experience things, then you won’t understand life; and if you don’t write, then you won’t know what you’re capable of creating.</p>
                                <br><li>This reminds me of ultra marathoner Dean Karnazes’ tip for running: to get better at running, just run faster. Something to be said about just doing it. </li>

                                 <p class="aside">The fate of Lu Xun in China — going from being an author to being a catchphrase and then back again — reflects the fate of China itself, and in Lu Xun we can trace the zigzags of history and detect the imprints of our social upheavals.</p>

                                    <li>The gov’t built 4 major ports in the same 400 mile coast. In 2003, all four ports were underutilized</li>
                                    <li>The push for student enrollment created debt for colleges and students.Moreover, students ultimately ended up jobless due to the massive influx of new grads. “Every year we [were] adding more than 1 million college graduates who cannot find work.”</li>
                                    <ul><li>In order to prevent 16M jobless Red Guards from destabilizing society, Mao asked the “educated youth [to] go to the countryside [and …]  receive further education from the poor and lower-middle peasants.”</li> </ul>
