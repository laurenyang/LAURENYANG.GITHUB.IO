						<p> <em>Klara and the Sun</em> is a casual, gentle science fiction that proposes a world where intelligent robots are the caretakers of our children. Perhaps because the narrator, Klara, is so temperate and softhearted, the book didn’t read like a typical science fiction (ie <a href="./ProjectHailMary.html"> Project Hail Mary</a>, and instead like a children’s storybook. 
                        <p>I picked this book up because of the hype - the critics were raving about it, the author is a Nobel prize winner, even Bill Gates reviewed it. I was excited for a thought provoking, could-not-put-down read. That’s not what I got. I had trouble finishing the book, and in fact pushed myself to the end to ensure I didn’t miss any “good parts.” This was close to a DNF for me: a bit too slow, the sci-fi themes were recycled (surprise: the robot is more than just a robot!), the prose didn’t particularly stand out to me. This is also why it took me over 2 months to finally write it’s review. To me, a good fiction 1) evokes strong emotion, 2) makes the reader feel invested in the story, and 3) spurs thought and further analysis. Klara and the Sun missed the mark on all three fronts. Regardless, I still want to read Kazuo Ishiguro’s other books, particularly Never Let Me Go and The Remains of the Day. </p>
                        <p>Even if <em>Klara and the Sun</em> did not do it for me, you should still give it a read and see for yourself. The premise and storyline itself is quality, just don’t expect the level of hype others have raved about. </p>

                                <li>“It must be nice sometimes to have no feelings. I envy you.” Josie’s mom said to Klara. <br> <mark class="highlight">&gt;This book is written in a world where the AFs (artificial friends) are more or less sentient. Klara’s narrative certainly reads like she has emotions. </mark> </li>
                                <li>“Until recently, I didn’t think that humans could choose loneliness. That there were sometimes forces more powerful than the wish to avoid loneliness.”</li>
                                <li>“And think what it’ll mean for you. You’ll be loved like nothing else in this world.” Josie’s mom said to Klara.<br> <mark class="highlight">&gt; Do humans and robots have the same desires - to belong, to have community, to be loved? Ishiguro suggests this rings true in his world.</mark> </li>
                                <li>“Do you believe in the human heart? I don’t mean simply the organ, obviously. I’m speaking in the poetic sense. The human heart. Do you think there is such a thing? Something that makes each of us special and individual? And if we just suppose that there is. Then don’t you think, in order to truly learn Josie, you’d have to learn not just her mannerisms but what’s deeply inside her? Wouldn’t you have to learn her heart?”</li>
                                <li>“Hope,” he said. “Damn thing never leaves you alone.”</li>
                                <li>“Sufficiently generous and liberal to be open to all students of high caliber, even some who haven’t benefited from genetic editing.” <br> <mark class="highlight">&gt;Ishiguro critiques genetic editing with exactly the situation Isaac Walterson outlines when evaluating the <a href="TheCodeBreakerJ.html">ethical consideration of germline edits</a> in the book <a href="TheCodeBreakerJ.html">The Code Breaker</a>. However enticing is the genetic supermarket, it poses serious risks like blurring the line between absolute and positional improvements, disabilities and traits, and more.</li>
                                <li>“What can children know about genuine love?”<br> <mark class="highlight">&gt;I agree. In retrospect, I took the sacrifices my parents made for me for granted as a child. I had no idea what they gave up for me - part of that is just a general lack of understanding regarding how the world works, an oversimplification of human emotion (ie, you are either happy or sad, you either love someone or not - things are binary), and a lack of where I stood relative to others (ie, how good I had it).</mark></li>
                                <li>Mr. Capaldi believed there was nothing special inside Josie that couldn’t be continued. He told the Mother he’d searched and searched and found nothing like that. But I believe now he was searching in the wrong place. There was something very special, but it wasn’t inside Josie. It was inside those who loved her. </li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><mark class="highlight">&gt;What a cold, heartless position to take, Mr. Capaldi! Do you eat rocks for breakfast?</mark></li>
                                    <li> <mark class="highlight">&gt;Makes you think, how are you measuring yourself - by your intrinsic value, or by your impact to the external world? Capaldi certainly takes the utilitarian view here.</mark></li>
