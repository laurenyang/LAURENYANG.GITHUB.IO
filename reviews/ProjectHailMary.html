						<p> <em>Project Hail Mary</em> was an exciting, could-not-put-down read. Weir does an excellent job crafting a story which is strange and otherworldly, yet realistic. Every detail is so well backed it almost reads as a non-fiction science fiction. Similar to The Martian, this story is grounded in the Scientific Method. I was impressed by Weirâ€™s commitment to Cold Hard Science, as he made a point to document the main characterâ€™s experiment after experiment.  </p>
                        <p>The nature of problem solving is similar to that of Sherlock Holmes, though the prose is much simpler. Although the premise was riveting, I wasnâ€™t impressed with the plot itself, since it was pretty predictable (man meets alien, slowly befriends alien, big disaster where alien sacrifices itself - or so the man thought, alien actually alive!!, man and alien remain best friends forever. The End)</p>
                        <p>Overall, I would recommend this as an entertaining read if youâ€™re looking to get lost in another world. Pure sci-fi satisfaction ðŸ›¸</p>
